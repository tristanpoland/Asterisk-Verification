# Asterisk's Account Security Notice

**Attention:** This is an important security notice regarding my Discord account and related accounts.

## Incident Overview

On 09/01/2024 at 3:46 PM, my Discord account under the username **@Asterisk** was compromised. This security breach has potentially affected associated accounts and owned accounts. I am actively working to regain control and secure all affected accounts.

### Immediate Actions Taken:

1. Reported the hack to Discord and other relevant platforms.
2. Changed passwords for accessible accounts.
3. Enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
4. Notified my contacts of the breach to prevent further issues.

### New Account Information

Please note that my new, secure Discord account name is **PGD**.

## Moving Forward
FOR NOW YOU CAN GO HERE: [BACKUP AND OVERHEAD DISCORD](https://discord.gg/qK5dmaAV)
Due to this incident and other concerns regarding Discord's recent lack of user privacy protection and new ownership, we have decided to create our own alternative to Discord. This new platform is called **HOP**. 

### HOP - Our New Platform

We're currently developing HOP as a secure and user-friendly alternative to Discord. While the platform is still in development, you can check out the progress and even "HOP" in now using the following link:

[HOP Platform](https://hop-socialize.w3spaces.com/index.html)

Stay tuned for updates on the development of this new platform.

## What You Should Do

If you've interacted with my account recently, please be cautious of any suspicious messages or activities. If you notice anything unusual, please report it to the respective platform immediately.

## How to Help

If you have any information about the breach or have noticed unusual activity related to my accounts, please contact me directly through secure channels.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.
